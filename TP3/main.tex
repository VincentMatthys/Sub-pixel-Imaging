% Syntax for using figure macros:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \singlefig{filename}{scalefactor}{caption}{label}
% \doublefig{\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {global caption}{label}
% \triplefig{\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {\subfig{filename}{scalefactor}{subcaption}{sublabel}}
%           {global caption}{label}
%
% Tips:
% - with scalefactor=1, a single figure will take the whole page width; a double figure, half page width; and a triple figure, a third of the page width
% - image files should be placed in the image folder
% - no need to put image extension to include the image
% - for vector graphics (plots), pdf figures are suggested
% - for images, jpg/png are suggested
% - labels can be left empty {}

\question{QIA.1: (i) Why is it important to have a similarity co-variant feature detector? (ii) How does this affect the descriptors computed at these detections? (iii) How does this affect the matching process?}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item It is important to have a similarity co-variant feature detector because of this reason. It is also important because of this other reason.
	\item The fact that the feature detector is co-variant causes the descriptors computed at these detections to have this and this other property.
	\item Having feature detectors with similarity co-variance and feature descriptors with this and that other property affects the matching process in this way.
\end{enumerate}

\question{QIA.2: Show the classification boundaries learned with the two different models. Compare their training error, and the expected test error, and discuss which model is superior.}

The two classification boundaries are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overfit}. As it can be observed, model A, represented in green, is producing a very irregular classification boundary which gives a training error of zero, while model B, represented in black, is producing a smoother classification boundary which mis-classifies a few examples of the training data.

However, although the training error is higher for model B than for model A, we expect model B to perform better on the test data, as its smoother classification boundary is more robust to the noise in the training data, while model A is overfitting to the noise in this particular training data.

It is therefore concluded that model B is superior, as it will offer better generalization properties.

\question{QIA.3: Show the detected features in the image for three different values of the peakThreshold option.}

The detected features with three different values of $peakThreshold$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:peakThreshold}. % if we want to refer to one particular subplot, we can use its sublabel instead: e.g. \ref{fig:th_0.0001}

\triplefig{\subfig{features_th1}{1}{$peakThreshold = 0.0001$}{fig:th_0.0001}} % sublabels used here
{\subfig{features_th2}{1}{$peakThreshold = 0.001$}{fig:th_0.001}}
{\subfig{features_th3}{1}{$peakThreshold = 0.01$}{fig:th_0.01}}
