From [Satellite Image Resolution Enhancement Using Complex Wavelet Transform](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/928f/a8611abd47bff5af03a50f27bb59bf73bfcb.pdf)
One  of the most important quality factors in images comes from its resolution. Interpolation in image processing is a well-known method to increase the resolution of a digital image. Interpolation has been widely  used in many image-processing applications such as facial reconstruction [1], multiple-description coding [2], and resolution enhancement [3], [4].
